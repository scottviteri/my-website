## Course Information

* *Course Organizer*: Richard Ngo
* *Content*: The AGI Safety Fundamentals: Alignment Course provides a high-level understanding of the AI alignment problem and some of the key research directions which aim to solve it. The course consists of 7 weeks of readings and discussion sessions (plus one optional week introducing the fundamentals of machine learning), and a final project. No background machine learning knowledge is required, but participants are expected to have some fluency in basic statistics and mathematical notation.

I had the opportunity to mentor for this program twice. For more information about the course, please visit the [official course page](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum).
