## Course Information

* *Course Coordinator*: Gabriel Mukobi
* *Faculty Sponsor*: Paul N. Edwards (STS)
* *Content*: This advanced course explores the frontier of current AI alignment research directions and helps students develop their own inside view on AI safety research. The course includes targeted readings, weekly group discussions, technical alignment exercises, and a final literature review or research proposal.

As a Discussion Facilitator for this course, I guided students through the complex issues surrounding AI alignment, helped them understand current research directions, and provided guidance on their projects.
