## Course Information

* *Course Coordinator*: Gabriel Mukobi
* *Faculty Sponsor*: Paul N. Edwards (STS)
* *Content*: This 8-week course explores the pressing ethical questions about what will happen if AI systems arenâ€™t aligned with our values. The course includes targeted readings, weekly group discussions, and an optional project. Basic knowledge about machine learning helps but is not required.

As a Discussion Facilitator for this course, I helped students understand the complex issues surrounding AI alignment, and provided guidance on their projects.
