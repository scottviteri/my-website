I am a PhD candidate in the [Center for Automated Reasoning](https://centaur.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Clark Barrett](https://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/).

My goal is to reduce existential risk from artificial intelligence by augmenting human intelligence. Towards this goal I am thinking about how to train an ML model to bridge the gap between the worldviews of two different intelligences. I have been charting out the space of design choices of ontology maps, and I am excited about this research direction going forward. I am also interested in neural network interpretability, and anything that would be useful to me in the scenario that I had read/write access to my own source code.

My background is in artificial intelligence and programming language theory. I was a computer science and electrical engineering major at MIT, where I contributed to research in AI and robotics. Afterwards I researched interactive theorem proving at CMU with Simon Dedeo, where I published on the use of abduction in mathematics to the Cognition journal. I am currently a 4th year PhD candidate at Stanford under Clark Barrett, where I have worked on various projects related to SMT solving and interactive theorem proving. I have changed my research direction to AI alignment as of this January due to my belief that it is the most morally significant project that I could be working on.

My primary character trait is curiosity, and I really love math.
